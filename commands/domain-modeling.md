# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active*
discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and
decisions down the moment they crystallise. Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is
not this skill — that's a one-line habit any command can do. This is for when you're changing
the model, not just consuming it.

This replaces the old `update-context` command: same job (own `CONTEXT.md`), plus ADRs,
multi-context support, and continuous mid-session upkeep instead of a one-shot refresh. It
complements `/evergreen` — `evergreen` captures session learnings and issue status;
this command owns the domain glossary and architectural decisions specifically.

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to
where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when there is something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists,
create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the
first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it
out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which
is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're
saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios.
Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force precision about the boundaries between
concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a
contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial
cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture
them as they happen, using the format below.

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat it as a spec,
a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions — it is a glossary and nothing
else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and one was picked
   for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR.

## CONTEXT.md format

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A one or two sentence description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request
```

Rules:

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and
  list the others under `_Avoid_`.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One or two sentences max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's context.** General programming concepts
  (timeouts, error types, utility patterns) don't belong even if the project uses them
  extensively. Before adding a term, ask: is this a concept unique to this context, or a
  general programming concept? Only the former belongs.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge. If all terms belong to a
  single cohesive area, a flat list is fine.

For multi-context repos, `CONTEXT-MAP.md` lists the contexts, where they live, and how they
relate:

```md
# Context Map

## Contexts

- [Ordering](./src/ordering/CONTEXT.md) — receives and tracks customer orders
- [Billing](./src/billing/CONTEXT.md) — generates invoices and processes payments

## Relationships

- **Ordering → Billing**: Ordering emits `OrderPlaced` events; Billing consumes them to
  generate invoices
```

Infer which structure applies: if `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists, read it to find contexts; if only
a root `CONTEXT.md` exists, single context; if neither exists, create a root `CONTEXT.md`
lazily when the first term is resolved. When multiple contexts exist, infer which one the
current topic relates to — if unclear, ask.

## ADR format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.
Scan the directory for the highest existing number and increment by one.

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was
made and *why* — not in filling out sections.

Only add these sections when they add genuine value — most ADRs won't need them:

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) —
  useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options** — only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

What qualifies as ADR-worthy:

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the
  read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain
  events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment
  target — not every library, just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other
  contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM
  because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance
  requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If GraphQL was considered and
  REST was picked for subtle reasons, record it — otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL
  again in six months.
